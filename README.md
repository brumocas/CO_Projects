## Getting Started

To get a local copy of the repository up and running, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following software installed:

- MATLAB/Simulink or Python (depending on the project)
- Git
- Any specific libraries or tools needed for the projects (check individual project directories for details)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/brumocas/CO_Projects.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd CO_Projects
   ```

## Usage

Each project directory contains specific instructions on how to run the code and experiment with the control and optimization techniques. Follow the README files or instructions within each directory for detailed usage information.

### Example

For the `Control_Systems` project:

1. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd Control_Systems
   ```
